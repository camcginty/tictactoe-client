# tictactoe-client

Created using HTMl, CSS, Javascript, and a (provided) backend API.
Tackling your first big project can be daunting. When it's something that sounds easy, like tic-tac-toe, it can actually be more intimidating. You just know you're overlooking something. What surprises are in store during this task?
Implementing the game logic and placing the game markers were the easier tasks for me: make an array, change the values of the items in the array as each spot is clicked, and check to see if three spots in the correct configuration all match.
My larger struggles centered around the forms and interactions with the API. I also had trouble with the layout. I learned that bootstrap had some inherent stylings that were overwriting styles I tried to implement. I learned to look through the elements and styles portion of dev tools on the page in order to find what could be blocking the styles I wrote.

And how does one put their own touch on a game like tic-tac-toe? Most people won't know it, but my color scheme is based on the asexual pride flag. More noticably, I injected my sense of humor into the feedback text.

Future versions would include:
- mobile-friendly view (include menu button to hide/show nav bar)
- local multiplayer (2 signed in users)
- play against the computer
- customized/stylistic game markers instead of basic text x and o
- online multiplayer
